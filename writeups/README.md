# Cybersecurity Write Ups

This repository contains my cybersecurity write ups, covering:

- Lab and home lab investigations  
- CTF style challenges and learning platforms  
- SOC style incident style reports  
- Short deep dives on specific techniques, tools, or alerts  

The goal is to document **how I think**, not only **what I did**.  
All content is for educational and reference use only and must be tailored to your own environment and use case.

## Purpose

This repository exists to:

1. **Strengthen my own understanding**  
   Writing is part of how I learn. Each write up forces me to explain what happened, why it mattered, and what should be done next.

2. **Showcase investigation and communication skills**  
   Many security roles, especially SOC lead or GRC oriented roles, require clear written communication. These write ups are examples of how I structure findings, timelines, and recommendations.

3. **Provide useful reference material**  
   Others can use these documents as reference for:
   - Investigation approaches  
   - Report structure  
   - Ideas for how to translate technical detail into business impact

<!-- ## Repository Structure

The structure may grow over time. The current layout is:

### `incidents/` ###

SOC or IR style write ups based on lab scenarios, simulations, or red versus blue exercises.

Typical contents:

- Executive summary  
- Scope and timeline  
- Technical analysis  
- Impact and risk  
- Recommendations and follow up items  

These are written in a format similar to what a SOC analyst or IR team might present to stakeholders.

---

### `labs/`

Write ups from hands on labs and learning platforms, for example:

- Hack The Box  
- TryHackMe  
- Custom home lab scenarios  

Focus areas:

- What was the objective  
- Key steps taken  
- What I learned  
- How this maps to detection, response, or hardening  

Sensitive or proprietary content is never included.

---

### `research-notes/`

Shorter notes and deep dives on topics such as:

- Specific attack techniques or TTPs  
- Detection or hunting ideas  
- Tool behavior and observations  

These are more informal than full incident reports, but still structured enough to be reused.

---

### `templates/` (optional / in progress)

Reusable structures for future reports, for example:

- Incident report template  
- Executive summary template  
- Lessons learned template  

These help keep my writing consistent and faster to produce.

## How to Read These Write Ups

Each document aims to answer at least these questions:

- What happened or what was the scenario  
- How did I approach the problem  
- What evidence was important  
- What was the root cause or main takeaway  
- What would I recommend as next steps or controls  

Some write ups focus on technical detail, others lean more toward business impact and governance. Together they reflect the blend of SOC operations and GRC thinking I am developing.

---

## Audience

This repository is intended for:

- **Recruiters and hiring managers**  
  To see how I communicate investigations, findings, and recommendations.

- **SOC analysts and students**  
  To get examples of structure and investigation approaches.

- **My future self**  
  As a knowledge base of past work and lessons learned.

## Skills Reflected Here

Across the different write ups, you will see examples of:

- Alert triage and investigation approaches  
- Log and evidence interpretation  
- Root cause and impact analysis  
- Written communication tailored to both technical and non-technical readers  
- Basic governance and risk framing when appropriate  

These are aligned with my long term path toward SOC manager or lead and GRC focused roles.
